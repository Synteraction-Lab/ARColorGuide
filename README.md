# AR Color Selection Guidelines

An interactive web application demonstrating research results on AR color selection guidelines for smart glasses. This project provides comprehensive color performance analysis and selection recommendations for different AR devices and environmental conditions.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¨ Color Performance Analysis
- Interactive charts showing clarity and comfort scores
- Device comparison (Xreal vs HoloLens)
- Environment analysis (Indoor vs Outdoor)
- 12 different hue selections with real-time performance data
- Visual color previews with recommendations

### ðŸ“Š Color Selection Guide
- Comprehensive color guidelines based on research data
- Visual color bars showing optimal ranges
- Device and environment-specific recommendations
- Clear categorization: Comfort, Clear, and Avoid ranges
- Interactive hover effects and tooltips

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** - Modern React with hooks
- **Recharts** - Interactive charts and data visualization
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with responsive design
